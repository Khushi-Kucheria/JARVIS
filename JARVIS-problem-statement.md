# Problem Statement: Just A Rather Very Intelligent System - J.A.R.V.I.S

## Problem Statement
The final project involves building your own NLP-based classifier, which can group various phrases into the following categories:
- Send Email
- Create List
- Set Reminder
- Search Google
- Greetings

To avoid starting from scratch, a few guiding steps have been provided below. However, these are completely optional, and if you are confident enough to start from scratch, feel free to do so.


## Guiding Steps

### Step 1: Load Dataset

### Step 2: Feature Extraction using NLP

### Step 3: Select a Machine Learning Model 

### Step 4: Train the model using the given dataset

### Step 5: Create a command-line interface to interact with the trained model


## Submission Guidelines
Submit a Jupyter Notebook which includes the command-line interface (CLI) and a way to load the weights of the trained model. Also submit the weights of the final trained model.
