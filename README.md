# J.A.R.V.I.S - Just A Rather Very Intelligent System (WiDS)

Welcome to **J.A.R.V.I.S** (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) — a Python-based intelligent assistant designed to showcase key concepts in **data manipulation**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **machine learning (ML)**. Built over the course of four weeks, this project combines theoretical learning with hands-on implementation using powerful Python libraries.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the journey from foundational Python skills to building a fully functional **NLP-based text classifier** that takes user input via a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** and predicts the appropriate category for the input phrase.

## 📅 Weekly Breakdown

### 🧠 Week 1: Python, NumPy & Pandas
- Built strong foundations in Python programming.
- Explored data structures, control flow, and function writing.
- Practiced data manipulation and cleaning using **NumPy** and **Pandas**.

### 🗣️ Week 2: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Utilized **SpaCy** for tokenization, POS tagging, and Named Entity Recognition (NER).
- Implemented **vectorization techniques** including:
  - One-Hot Encoding
  - Bag of Words (BoW)
  - TF-IDF
- Developed a custom SpaCy pipeline and solved real-world text processing problems using regex.

### 🤖 Week 3: Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn
- Explored the fundamentals of **machine learning** using **Scikit-Learn**.
- Topics covered:
  - Model types (Decision Trees, SVMs, Neural Networks)
  - Training and testing workflows
  - Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall
  - Feature extraction and preprocessing pipelines
  - Basics of **hyperparameter tuning**

### 💡 Week 4: Final Project – NLP-Based Text Classifier
- Built a complete **text classification system** using the concepts learned.
- Key steps:
  - **Dataset Preparation**: Phrases and labeled categories
  - **Feature Extraction**: Using TF-IDF and other NLP techniques
  - **Model Selection & Training**: Tried various models
  - **Evaluation**: Tested the model using standard metrics
  - **Command-Line Interface**: Created an interactive CLI to predict categories based on user input
